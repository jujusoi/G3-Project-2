The Taming of the Shrew's ongoing appeal is easy to understand - it offers almost production-proof farce, plus the perennially popular joke of the battle of the sexes - but Katherina's story, and the joke of taming an unruly woman have become increasingly controversial. This edition of The Taming of the Shrew examines how theatre directors and performers have explored the complexities of Katherina's story and that of Christopher Sly, the poor man whose story frames that of Katherine. The edition surveys a wide variety of theatrical interpretations of the play in the English-speaking world, particularly in the UK, North America, and Australia and New Zealand. It informs readers about precise details of the stage action in the context of contemporary theatrical, social and political conditions.","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publish_year":2002,"author":"William Shakespeare","page_count":300,"mature":false,"icon":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yCeGJKSIZkYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","average_score":3.5,"uploaded_by":1,"category_name":["Drama"],"id":15},{"book_title":"An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation","publish_year":1823,"author":"Jeremy Bentham","page_count":330,"mature":false,"icon":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ffTnrjDFKNEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","uploaded_by":1,"category_name":["Civil law"],"id":16},{"book_title":"Spirit Bound","book_description":"The international number 1 bestselling Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead is now a major motion picture.

After a long and heartbreaking journey to Siberia, Dimitri's birthplace, Rose Hathaway has finally returned to St. Vladimir's - and to her best friend, Lissa Dragomir. It's graduation, and the girls can't wait for their real lives outside the Academy's cold iron gates to finally begin. But even with the intrigue and excitement of court life looming, Rose's heart still aches for Dimitri. He's out there, somewhere. She failed to kill him when she had the chance, and now her worst fears are about to come true. Dimitri has tasted her blood, and she knows in her heart that he is hunting her. And if Rose won't join him, he won't rest until he has silenced her . . . forever.
